PICBoot Bootloader
==================

Under Active Devlopment
-----------------------
I'm currently developing this bootloader for the EmbeddedFun platform. It **IS NOT** in a working state yet. I will post more info as it becomes functional. The end product will be an SD card-based bootloader that will read raw hex files created in MPLAB to program the target device.
